# 0x0D-preprocessor

## Introduction
This repository contains information and resources related to the 0x0D preprocessor. In this README, you will find an overview of what the preprocessor is and how it can be used.

## What is a Preprocessor?
A preprocessor is a tool or program that performs text-based transformations on the source code before it is compiled. In many programming languages, including C and C++, the preprocessor is an essential part of the compilation process. It allows you to define macros, include external files, and perform conditional compilation.

## Usage
To use the 0x0D preprocessor, follow these steps:

1. Step one.
2. Step two.
3. Step three.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the 0x0D preprocessor:

```c
// Example code using the preprocessor
#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14159265

int main() {
    printf("The value of PI is %f\n", PI);
    return 0;
}
